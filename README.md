# SprintFix + Item Prioritizations
Adds MC-152728 back into the game without breaking parkour mechanics. Useful for players that enjoy 1.8 combat where blocking should reset sprint. Players can still sneak sprint, and use an elytra while sprinting. Best of both worlds!

This mod also has a custom payload to enable better item prioritizations for servers where 1.8 style combat and sword blocking are enabled.
