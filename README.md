# SprintFix + Item Prioritizations + Particle Fixes
Adds MC-152728 back into the game without breaking parkour mechanics. Useful for players that enjoy 1.8 combat where blocking should reset sprint. Players can still sneak sprint, and use an elytra while sprinting. Best of both worlds!
Sharpness particles also always show, even if the player is under invincibility timer.
This mod also has a custom payload to enable better item prioritizations for servers where 1.8 style combat and sword blocking are enabled. However, this only affects what happens client side and server owners will have to mod the server to prioritize the offhand. This can be done by adding more logic to `ServerGamePacketListenerImpl.handleUseItem()`. Due to most servers running Paper software, I would recommend to use Paper's patch system. In the future, I plan to bundle the server sided logic into a plugin if possible to make it easier to use this version of the mod.
